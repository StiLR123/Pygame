# Pygame

About
Circuit Builder is a Python application that aims to teach children and teens about electrical circuits in a game-like way. This project is intended for mainly highschool/middleschool physics students or individuals who want to learn about electrcicty and circuits, however it may teach to more complicated systems for higher-level students in the future. It is both my first ever Python project and first game I've created. 

Features
-Procedurally generated sounds.
-Different missions and tasks the player must complete.
-Contains a variety of different electrical components.
